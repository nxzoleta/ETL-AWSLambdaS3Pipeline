# Project Title: ETL Pipeline with AWS Lambda and S3

## Project Description
In this project, I built an ETL pipeline using AWS Lambda, S3, and Glue to process raw data into a clean format and load it into a Redshift data warehouse.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- AWS Lambda
- AWS S3
- AWS Glue
- AWS Redshift
- Python (Boto3)

## Architecture

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Upload raw data to the S3 bucket.
2. Trigger the Lambda function to transform the data.
3. Load the transformed data into Redshift.

## Lessons Learned
- Using Lambda for serverless ETL pipelines.
- Integrating AWS Glue for automated schema discovery.
